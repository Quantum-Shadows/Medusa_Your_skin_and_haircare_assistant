# Medusa_Your_skin_and_haircare_assistant

## **1. Introduction**

Medusa is a witty, friendly chat bot designed to provide personalised skin and hair care advice with a playful, mythical twist. By combining skincare recommendations with humour that is inspired by Medusa’s legendary story, we have attempted to make users enjoy both practical tips and an engaging and interactive experience.
 
## **2. Ideation and Planning**
We aimed to create a chatbot that not only offers personalised skin and hair care suggestions, but also responds with humour and creativity. Medusa was designed for users seeking skin and hair care tips while enjoying a light-hearted conversation.
 
### **2.1. Target Audience**
Individuals seeking customised skincare and haircare advice, and appreciate creative, humorous interactions.

### **2.2. Core Features**
Personalised recommendations for hair and skin care.
Mythical and humorous themes, referencing Medusa’s ancient story.
A welcome page to introduce users to Medusa’s magical world.
Dark and light theme options for a customisable user experience.
 
## **3. Technology Stack**
Gemini API: It provided the natural language processing backbone for understanding user inputs and delivering customised recommendations. 
Python: It powered Medusa’s backend, API integration, frontend with Streamlit, and enabled dynamic user interactions and customization.
Streamlit Framework: It was used for the frontend, chosen for its simplicity and seamless integration with the Gemini API. It allowed us to design an interface that fit Medusa’s mythical theme, complete with custom font colours and user-friendly theming options.
 
## **4. Chatbot Design and Personality**
We shaped Medusa’s persona to be fun, warm, and mythologically inspired. Her responses incorporate playful remarks about her “stone skin” and “snake hair” while providing product recommendations referred to as “magical potions” or “elixirs.”

## **5. Challenges and Solutions**
Balancing humour with accuracy was one of our biggest challenges. We resolved this by using a prompt that mentioned humour only in the introduction of her responses, while focusing on clear, practical advice in the rest.
Additionally, we ensured Medusa could handle diverse queries by designing prompts to adapt her responses based on users' individual skin and hair types.
